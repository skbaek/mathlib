# Mathlib tactics #

In addition to [core tactics](https://leanprover.github.io/reference/tactics.html),
mathlib provides a number of specific interactive tactics and commands.
Here we document the mostly commonly used ones.

### tfae

The `tfae` tactic suite is a set of tactics that help with proving that certain
propositions are equivalent.
In `data/list/basic.lean` there is a section devoted to propositions of the
form
```lean
tfae [p1, p2, ..., pn]
```
where `p1`, `p2`, through, `pn` are terms of type `Prop`.
This proposition asserts that all the `pi` are pairwise equivalent.
There are results that allow to extract the equivalence
of two propositions `pi` and `pj`.

To prove a goal of the form `tfae [p1, p2, ..., pn]`, there are two
tactics.  The first tactic is `tfae_have`.  As an argument it takes an
expression of the form `i arrow j`, where `i` and `j` are two positive
natural numbers, and `arrow` is an arrow such as `→`, `->`, `←`, `<-`,
`↔`, or `<->`.  The tactic `tfae_have : i arrow j` sets up a subgoal in
which the user has to prove the equivalence (or implication) of `pi` and `pj`.

The remaining tactic, `tfae_finish`, is a finishing tactic. It
collects all implications and equivalences from the local context and
computes their transitive closure to close the
main goal.

`tfae_have` and `tfae_finish` can be used together in a proof as
follows:

```lean
example (a b c d : Prop) : tfae [a,b,c,d] :=
begin
  tfae_have : 3 → 1,
  { /- prove c → a -/ },
  tfae_have : 2 → 3,
  { /- prove b → c -/ },
  tfae_have : 2 ← 1,
  { /- prove a → b -/ },
  tfae_have : 4 ↔ 2,
  { /- prove d ↔ b -/ },
    -- a b c d : Prop,
    -- tfae_3_to_1 : c → a,
    -- tfae_2_to_3 : b → c,
    -- tfae_1_to_2 : a → b,
    -- tfae_4_iff_2 : d ↔ b
    -- ⊢ tfae [a, b, c, d]
  tfae_finish,
end
```

### rcases

The `rcases` tactic is the same as `cases`, but with more flexibility in the
`with` pattern syntax to allow for recursive case splitting. The pattern syntax
uses the following recursive grammar:

```lean
patt ::= (patt_list "|")* patt_list
patt_list ::= id | "_" | "⟨" (patt ",")* patt "⟩"
```

A pattern like `⟨a, b, c⟩ | ⟨d, e⟩` will do a split over the inductive
datatype, naming the first three parameters of the first constructor as
`a,b,c` and the first two of the second constructor `d,e`. If the list
is not as long as the number of arguments to the constructor or the
number of constructors, the remaining variables will be automatically
named. If there are nested brackets such as `⟨⟨a⟩, b | c⟩ | d` then
these will cause more case splits as necessary. If there are too many
arguments, such as `⟨a, b, c⟩` for splitting on `∃ x, ∃ y, p x`, then it
will be treated as `⟨a, ⟨b, c⟩⟩`, splitting the last parameter as
necessary.

`rcases` also has special support for quotient types: quotient induction into Prop works like
matching on the constructor `quot.mk`.

`rcases? e` will perform case splits on `e` in the same way as `rcases e`,
but rather than accepting a pattern, it does a maximal cases and prints the
pattern that would produce this case splitting. The default maximum depth is 5,
but this can be modified with `rcases? e : n`.

### rintro

The `rintro` tactic is a combination of the `intros` tactic with `rcases` to
allow for destructuring patterns while introducing variables. See `rcases` for
a description of supported patterns. For example, `rintros (a | ⟨b, c⟩) ⟨d, e⟩`
will introduce two variables, and then do case splits on both of them producing
two subgoals, one with variables `a d e` and the other with `b c d e`.

`rintro?` will introduce and case split on variables in the same way as
`rintro`, but will also print the `rintro` invocation that would have the same
result. Like `rcases?`, `rintro? : n` allows for modifying the
depth of splitting; the default is 5.

### simpa

This is a "finishing" tactic modification of `simp`. It has two forms.

* `simpa [rules, ...] using e` will simplify the goal and the type of
  `e` using `rules`, then try to close the goal using `e`.

  Simplifying the type of `e` makes it more likely to match the goal
  (which has also been simplified). This construction also tends to be
  more robust under changes to the simp lemma set.

* `simpa [rules, ...]` will simplify the goal and the type of a
  hypothesis `this` if present in the context, then try to close the goal using
  the `assumption` tactic.

### replace

Acts like `have`, but removes a hypothesis with the same name as
this one. For example if the state is `h : p ⊢ goal` and `f : p → q`,
then after `replace h := f h` the goal will be `h : q ⊢ goal`,
where `have h := f h` would result in the state `h : p, h : q ⊢ goal`.
This can be used to simulate the `specialize` and `apply at` tactics
of Coq.

### elide/unelide

The `elide n (at ...)` tactic hides all subterms of the target goal or hypotheses
beyond depth `n` by replacing them with `hidden`, which is a variant
on the identity function. (Tactics should still mostly be able to see
through the abbreviation, but if you want to unhide the term you can use
`unelide`.)

The `unelide (at ...)` tactic removes all `hidden` subterms in the target
types (usually added by `elide`).

### finish/clarify/safe

These tactics do straightforward things: they call the simplifier, split conjunctive assumptions,
eliminate existential quantifiers on the left, and look for contradictions. They rely on ematching
and congruence closure to try to finish off a goal at the end.

The procedures *do* split on disjunctions and recreate the smt state for each terminal call, so
they are only meant to be used on small, straightforward problems.

* finish:  solves the goal or fails
* clarify: makes as much progress as possible while not leaving more than one goal
* safe:    splits freely, finishes off whatever subgoals it can, and leaves the rest

All accept an optional list of simplifier rules, typically definitions that should be expanded.
(The equations and identities should not refer to the local context.)

### ring

Evaluate expressions in the language of (semi-)rings.
Based on [Proving Equalities in a Commutative Ring Done Right in Coq](http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/courses/tt-2014/read/10.1.1.61.3041.pdf) by Benjamin Grégoire and Assia Mahboubi.

### congr'

Same as the `congr` tactic, but takes an optional argument which gives
the depth of recursive applications. This is useful when `congr`
is too aggressive in breaking down the goal. For example, given
`⊢ f (g (x + y)) = f (g (y + x))`, `congr'` produces the goals `⊢ x = y`
and `⊢ y = x`, while `congr' 2` produces the intended `⊢ x + y = y + x`.
If, at any point, a subgoal matches a hypothesis then the subgoal will be closed.

### convert

The `exact e` and `refine e` tactics require a term `e` whose type is
definitionally equal to the goal. `convert e` is similar to `refine
e`, but the type of `e` is not required to exactly match the
goal. Instead, new goals are created for differences between the type
of `e` and the goal. For example, in the proof state

```lean
n : ℕ,
e : prime (2 * n + 1)
⊢ prime (n + n + 1)
```

the tactic `convert e` will change the goal to

```lean
⊢ n + n = 2 * n
```

In this example, the new goal can be solved using `ring`.

The syntax `convert ← e` will reverse the direction of the new goals
(producing `⊢ 2 * n = n + n` in this example).

Internally, `convert e` works by creating a new goal asserting that
the goal equals the type of `e`, then simplifying it using
`congr'`. The syntax `convert e using n` can be used to control the
depth of matching (like `congr' n`). In the example, `convert e using
1` would produce a new goal `⊢ n + n + 1 = 2 * n + 1`.

### unfold_coes

Unfold coercion-related definitions

### Instance cache tactics

For performance reasons, Lean does not automatically update its database
of class instances during a proof. The group of tactics described below
helps forcing such updates. For a simple (but very artificial) example,
consider the function `default` from the core library. It has type 
`Π (α : Sort u) [inhabited α], α`, so one can use `default α` only if Lean 
can find a registered instance of `inhabited α`. Because the database of
such instance is not automatically updated during a proof, the following
attempt won't work (Lean will not pick up the instance from the local
context):
```lean
def my_id (α : Type) : α → α :=
begin
  intro x,
  have : inhabited α := ⟨x⟩,
  exact default α, -- Won't work!
end
```
However, it will work, producing the identity function, if one replaces have by its variant `haveI` described below.

* `resetI`: Reset the instance cache. This allows any instances
  currently in the context to be used in typeclass inference.

* `unfreezeI`: Unfreeze local instances, which allows us to revert
  instances in the context

* `introI`/`introsI`: `intro`/`intros` followed by `resetI`. Like
  `intro`/`intros`, but uses the introduced variable in typeclass inference.

* `haveI`/`letI`: `have`/`let` followed by `resetI`. Used to add typeclasses
  to the context so that they can be used in typeclass inference. The syntax
  `haveI := <proof>` and `haveI : t := <proof>` is supported, but
  `haveI : t, from _` and `haveI : t, { <proof> }` are not; in these cases
  use `have : t, { <proof> }, resetI` directly).

* `exactI`: `resetI` followed by `exact`. Like `exact`, but uses all
  variables in the context for typeclass inference.

### library_search

`library_search` is a tactic to identify existing lemmas in the library. It tries to close the
current goal by applying a lemma from the library, then discharging any new goals using
`solve_by_elim`.

Typical usage is:
```
example (n m k : ℕ) : n * (m - k) = n * m - n * k :=
by library_search -- exact nat.mul_sub_left_distrib n m k
```

`library_search` prints a trace message showing the proof it found, shown above as a comment.
Typically you will then copy and paste this proof, replacing the call to `library_search`.

### find

The `find` command from `tactic.find` allows to find lemmas using
pattern matching. For instance:

```lean
import tactic.find

#find _ + _ = _ + _
#find (_ : ℕ) + _ = _ + _
```

### solve_by_elim

The tactic `solve_by_elim` repeatedly applies assumptions to the current goal, and succeeds if this eventually discharges the main goal.
```lean
solve_by_elim { discharger := `[cc] }
```
also attempts to discharge the goal using congruence closure before each round of applying assumptions.

`solve_by_elim*` tries to solve all goals together, using backtracking if a solution for one goal
makes other goals impossible.

By default `solve_by_elim` also applies `congr_fun` and `congr_arg` against the goal.

The assumptions can be modified with similar syntax as for `simp`:
* `solve_by_elim [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` also applies the named lemmas (or all lemmas tagged with the named
attributes).
* `solve_by_elim only [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` does not include the local context, `congr_fun`, or `congr_arg`
unless they are explicitly included.
* `solve_by_elim [-id_1, ... -id_n]` uses the default assumptions, removing the specified ones.

### ext1 / ext

 * `ext1 id` selects and apply one extensionality lemma (with
    attribute `extensionality`), using `id`, if provided, to name a
    local constant introduced by the lemma. If `id` is omitted, the
    local constant is named automatically, as per `intro`.

 * `ext` applies as many extensionality lemmas as possible;
 * `ext ids`, with `ids` a list of identifiers, finds extentionality
    and applies them until it runs out of identifiers in `ids` to name
    the local constants.

When trying to prove:

  ```lean
  α β : Type,
  f g : α → set β
  ⊢ f = g
  ```

applying `ext x y` yields:

  ```lean
  α β : Type,
  f g : α → set β,
  x : α,
  y : β
  ⊢ y ∈ f x ↔ y ∈ g x
  ```

by applying functional extensionality and set extensionality.

A maximum depth can be provided with `ext x y z : 3`.

### The `extensionality` attribute

 Tag lemmas of the form:

 ```lean
 @[extensionality]
 lemma my_collection.ext (a b : my_collection)
   (h : ∀ x, a.lookup x = b.lookup y) :
   a = b := ...
 ```

 The attribute indexes extensionality lemma using the type of the
 objects (i.e. `my_collection`) which it gets from the statement of
 the lemma.  In some cases, the same lemma can be used to state the
 extensionality of multiple types that are definitionally equivalent.

 ```lean
 attribute [extensionality [(→),thunk,stream]] funext
 ```

 Those parameters are cumulative. The following are equivalent:

 ```lean
 attribute [extensionality [(→),thunk]] funext
 attribute [extensionality [stream]] funext
 ```

 and

 ```lean
 attribute [extensionality [(→),thunk,stream]] funext
 ```

 One removes type names from the list for one lemma with:

 ```lean
 attribute [extensionality [-stream,-thunk]] funext
 ```

 Finally, the following:

 ```lean
 @[extensionality]
 lemma my_collection.ext (a b : my_collection)
   (h : ∀ x, a.lookup x = b.lookup y) :
   a = b := ...
 ```

 is equivalent to

 ```lean
 @[extensionality *]
 lemma my_collection.ext (a b : my_collection)
   (h : ∀ x, a.lookup x = b.lookup y) :
   a = b := ...
 ```

 The `*` parameter indicates to simply infer the
 type from the lemma's statement.

 This allows us specify type synonyms along with the type
 that referred to in the lemma statement.

 ```lean
 @[extensionality [*,my_type_synonym]]
 lemma my_collection.ext (a b : my_collection)
   (h : ∀ x, a.lookup x = b.lookup y) :
   a = b := ...
 ```

### refine_struct

`refine_struct { .. }` acts like `refine` but works only with structure instance
literals. It creates a goal for each missing field and tags it with the name of the
field so that `have_field` can be used to generically refer to the field currently
being refined.

As an example, we can use `refine_struct` to automate the construction semigroup
instances:

```lean
refine_struct ( { .. } : semigroup α ),
-- case semigroup, mul
-- α : Type u,
-- ⊢ α → α → α

-- case semigroup, mul_assoc
-- α : Type u,
-- ⊢ ∀ (a b c : α), a * b * c = a * (b * c)
```

`have_field`, used after `refine_struct _` poses `field` as a local constant
with the type of the field of the current goal:

```lean
refine_struct ({ .. } : semigroup α),
{ have_field, ... },
{ have_field, ... },
```
behaves like
```lean
refine_struct ({ .. } : semigroup α),
{ have field := @semigroup.mul, ... },
{ have field := @semigroup.mul_assoc, ... },
```

### apply_rules

`apply_rules hs n` applies the list of lemmas `hs` and `assumption` on the
first goal and the resulting subgoals, iteratively, at most `n` times.
`n` is optional, equal to 50 by default.
`hs` can contain user attributes: in this case all theorems with this
attribute are added to the list of rules.

For instance:

```lean
@[user_attribute]
meta def mono_rules : user_attribute :=
{ name := `mono_rules,
  descr := "lemmas usable to prove monotonicity" }

attribute [mono_rules] add_le_add mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right

lemma my_test {a b c d e : real} (h1 : a ≤ b) (h2 : c ≤ d) (h3 : 0 ≤ e) :
a + c * e + a + c + 0 ≤ b + d * e + b + d + e :=
-- any of the following lines solve the goal:
add_le_add (add_le_add (add_le_add (add_le_add h1 (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right h2 h3)) h1 ) h2) h3
by apply_rules [add_le_add, mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right]
by apply_rules [mono_rules]
by apply_rules mono_rules
```

### h_generalize

`h_generalize Hx : e == x` matches on `cast _ e` in the goal and replaces it with
`x`. It also adds `Hx : e == x` as an assumption. If `cast _ e` appears multiple
times (not necessarily with the same proof), they are all replaced by `x`. `cast`
`eq.mp`, `eq.mpr`, `eq.subst`, `eq.substr`, `eq.rec` and `eq.rec_on` are all treated
as casts.

 - `h_generalize Hx : e == x with h` adds hypothesis `α = β` with `e : α, x : β`;
 - `h_generalize Hx : e == x with _` chooses automatically chooses the name of
    assumption `α = β`;
  - `h_generalize! Hx : e == x` reverts `Hx`;
  - when `Hx` is omitted, assumption `Hx : e == x` is not added.

### pi_instance

`pi_instance` constructs an instance of `my_class (Π i : I, f i)`
where we know `Π i, my_class (f i)`. If an order relation is required,
it defaults to `pi.partial_order`. Any field of the instance that
`pi_instance` cannot construct is left untouched and generated as a
new goal.

### assoc_rewrite

`assoc_rewrite [h₀, ← h₁] at ⊢ h₂` behaves like
`rewrite [h₀, ← h₁] at ⊢ h₂` with the exception that associativity is
used implicitly to make rewriting possible.

## restate_axiom

`restate_axiom` makes a new copy of a structure field, first definitionally simplifying the type.
This is useful to remove `auto_param` or `opt_param` from the statement.

As an example, we have:
```lean
structure A :=
(x : ℕ)
(a' : x = 1 . skip)

example (z : A) : z.x = 1 := by rw A.a' -- rewrite tactic failed, lemma is not an equality nor a iff

restate_axiom A.a'
example (z : A) : z.x = 1 := by rw A.a
```

By default, `restate_axiom` names the new lemma by removing a trailing `'`, or otherwise appending
`_lemma` if there is no trailing `'`. You can also give `restate_axiom` a second argument to
specify the new name, as in
```lean
restate_axiom A.a f
example (z : A) : z.x = 1 := by rw A.f
```

## def_replacer

`def_replacer foo` sets up a stub definition `foo : tactic unit`, which can
effectively be defined and re-defined later, by tagging definitions with `@[foo]`.

- `@[foo] meta def foo_1 : tactic unit := ...` replaces the current definition of `foo`.
- `@[foo] meta def foo_2 (old : tactic unit) : tactic unit := ...` replaces the current
  definition of `foo`, and provides access to the previous definition via `old`.
  (The argument can also be an `option (tactic unit)`, which is provided as `none` if
  this is the first definition tagged with `@[foo]` since `def_replacer` was invoked.)

`def_replacer foo : α → β → tactic γ` allows the specification of a replacer with
custom input and output types. In this case all subsequent redefinitions must have the
same type, or the type `α → β → tactic γ → tactic γ` or
`α → β → option (tactic γ) → tactic γ` analogously to the previous cases.

## tidy

`tidy` attempts to use a variety of conservative tactics to solve the goals.
In particular, `tidy` uses the `chain` tactic to repeatedly apply a list of tactics to
the goal and recursively on new goals, until no tactic makes further progress.

`tidy` can report the tactic script it found using `tidy?`. As an example
```lean
example : ∀ x : unit, x = unit.star :=
begin
  tidy? -- Prints the trace message: "intros x, exact dec_trivial"
end
```

The default list of tactics can be found by looking up the definition of
[`default_tidy_tactics`](https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/tactic/tidy.lean).

This list can be overriden using `tidy { tactics :=  ... }`. (The list must be a list of
`tactic string`, so that `tidy?` can report a usable tactic script.)

## linarith

`linarith` attempts to find a contradiction between hypotheses that are linear (in)equalities.
Equivalently, it can prove a linear inequality by assuming its negation and proving `false`.

In theory, `linarith` should prove any goal that is true in the theory of linear arithmetic over the rationals. While there is some special handling for non-dense orders like `nat` and `int`, this tactic is not complete for these theories and will not prove every true goal.

An example:
```lean
example (x y z : ℚ) (h1 : 2*x  < 3*y) (h2 : -4*x + 2*z < 0)
        (h3 : 12*y - 4* z < 0)  : false :=
by linarith
```

`linarith` will use all appropriate hypotheses and the negation of the goal, if applicable.

`linarith h1 h2 h3` will ohly use the local hypotheses `h1`, `h2`, `h3`.

`linarith using [t1, t2, t3]` will add `t1`, `t2`, `t3` to the local context and then run
`linarith`.

`linarith {discharger := tac, restrict_type := tp, exfalso := ff}` takes a config object with three optional
arguments.
* `discharger` specifies a tactic to be used for reducing an algebraic equation in the
proof stage. The default is `ring`. Other options currently include `ring SOP` or `simp` for basic
problems.
* `restrict_type` will only use hypotheses that are inequalities over `tp`. This is useful
if you have e.g. both integer and rational valued inequalities in the local context, which can
sometimes confuse the tactic.
* If `exfalso` is false, `linarith` will fail when the goal is neither an inequality nor `false`. (True by default.)

## choose

`choose a b h using hyp` takes an hypothesis `hyp` of the form
`∀ (x : X) (y : Y), ∃ (a : A) (b : B), P x y a b` for some `P : X → Y → A → B → Prop` and outputs
into context a function `a : X → Y → A`, `b : X → Y → B` and a proposition `h` stating
`∀ (x : X) (y : Y), P x y (a x y) (b x y)`. It presumably also works with dependent versions.

Example:

```lean
example (h : ∀n m : ℕ, ∃i j, m = n + i ∨ m + j = n) : true :=
begin
  choose i j h using h,
  guard_hyp i := ℕ → ℕ → ℕ,
  guard_hyp j := ℕ → ℕ → ℕ,
  guard_hyp h := ∀ (n m : ℕ), m = n + i n m ∨ m + j n m = n,
  trivial
end
```

## squeeze_simp / squeeze_simpa

`squeeze_simp` and `squeeze_simpa` perform the same task with
the difference that `squeeze_simp` relates to `simp` while
`squeeze_simpa` relates to `simpa`. The following applies to both
`squeeze_simp` and `squeeze_simpa`.

`squeeze_simp` behaves like `simp` (including all its arguments)
and prints a `simp only` invokation to skip the search through the
`simp` lemma list.

For instance, the following is easily solved with `simp`:

```lean
example : 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 := by simp
```

To guide the proof search and speed it up, we may replace `simp`
with `squeeze_simp`:

```lean
example : 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 := by squeeze_simp
-- prints: simp only [add_zero, eq_self_iff_true, zero_add]
```

`squeeze_simp` suggests a replacement which we can use instead of
`squeeze_simp`.

```lean
example : 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 := by simp only [add_zero, eq_self_iff_true, zero_add]
```

`squeeze_simp only` prints nothing as it already skips the `simp` list.

This tactic is useful for speeding up the compilation of a complete file.
Steps:

   1. search and replace ` simp` with ` squeeze_simp` (the space helps avoid the
      replacement of `simp` in `@[simp]`) throughout the file.
   2. Starting at the beginning of the file, go to each printout in turn, copy
      the suggestion in place of `squeeze_simp`.
   3. after all the suggestions were applied, search and replace `squeeze_simp` with
      `simp` to remove the occurrences of `squeeze_simp` that did not produce a suggestion.

Known limitation(s):
  * in cases where `squeeze_simp` is used after a `;` (e.g. `cases x; squeeze_simp`),
    `squeeze_simp` will produce as many suggestions as the number of goals it is applied to.
    It is likely that none of the suggestion is a good replacement but they can all be
    combined by concatenating their list of lemmas.

## fin_cases
`fin_cases h` performs case analysis on a hypothesis of the form
1) `h : A`, where `[fintype A]` is available, or
2) `h ∈ A`, where `A : finset X`, `A : multiset X` or `A : list X`.

`fin_cases *` performs case analysis on all suitable hypotheses.

As an example, in
```
example (f : ℕ → Prop) (p : fin 3) (h0 : f 0) (h1 : f 1) (h2 : f 2) : f p.val :=
begin
  fin_cases p; simp,
  all_goals { assumption }
end
```
after `fin_cases p; simp`, there are three goals, `f 0`, `f 1`, and `f 2`.

## conv
The `conv` tactic is built-in to lean. Currently mathlib additionally provides
   * `erw`,
   * `ring` and `ring2`, and
   * `norm_num`
inside `conv` blocks. Also, as a shorthand `conv_lhs` and `conv_rhs`
are provided, so that
```
example : 0 + 0 = 0 :=
begin
  conv_lhs {simp}
end
```
just means
```
example : 0 + 0 = 0 :=
begin
  conv {to_lhs, simp}
end
```
and likewise for `to_rhs`.

### mono

- `mono` applies a monotonicity rule.
- `mono*` applies monotonicity rules repetitively.
- `mono with x ≤ y` or `mono with [0 ≤ x,0 ≤ y]` creates an assertion for the listed
  propositions. Those help to select the right monotonicity rule.
- `mono left` or `mono right` is useful when proving strict orderings:
   for `x + y < w + z` could be broken down into either
    - left:  `x ≤ w` and `y < z` or
    - right: `x < w` and `y ≤ z`

To use it, first import `tactic.monotonicity`.

Here is an example of mono:

```lean
example (x y z k : ℤ)
  (h : 3 ≤ (4 : ℤ))
  (h' : z ≤ y) :
  (k + 3 + x) - y ≤ (k + 4 + x) - z :=
begin
  mono, -- unfold `(-)`, apply add_le_add
  { -- ⊢ k + 3 + x ≤ k + 4 + x
    mono, -- apply add_le_add, refl
    -- ⊢ k + 3 ≤ k + 4
    mono },
  { -- ⊢ -y ≤ -z
    mono /- apply neg_le_neg -/ }
end
```

More succinctly, we can prove the same goal as:

```lean
example (x y z k : ℤ)
  (h : 3 ≤ (4 : ℤ))
  (h' : z ≤ y) :
  (k + 3 + x) - y ≤ (k + 4 + x) - z :=
by mono*

### ac_mono

`ac_mono` reduces the `f x ⊑ f y`, for some relation `⊑` and a
monotonic function `f` to `x ≺ y`.

`ac_mono*` unwraps monotonic functions until it can't.

`ac_mono^k`, for some literal number `k` applies monotonicity `k`
times.

`ac_mono h`, with `h` a hypothesis, unwraps monotonic functions and
uses `h` to solve the remaining goal. Can be combined with `*` or `^k`:
`ac_mono* h`

`ac_mono : p` asserts `p` and uses it to discharge the goal result
unwrapping a series of monotonic functions. Can be combined with * or
^k: `ac_mono* : p`

In the case where `f` is an associative or commutative operator,
`ac_mono` will consider any possible permutation of its arguments and
use the one the minimizes the difference between the left-hand side
and the right-hand side.

To use it, first import `tactic.monotonicity`.

`ac_mono` can be used as follows:

```lean
example (x y z k m n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : z ≥ 0)
  (h₁ : x ≤ y) :
  (m + x + n) * z + k ≤ z * (y + n + m) + k :=
begin
  ac_mono,
  -- ⊢ (m + x + n) * z ≤ z * (y + n + m)
  ac_mono,
  -- ⊢ m + x + n ≤ y + n + m
  ac_mono,
end
```

As with `mono*`, `ac_mono*` solves the goal in one go and so does
`ac_mono* h₁`. The latter syntax becomes especially interesting in the
following example:

```lean
example (x y z k m n : ℕ)
  (h₀ : z ≥ 0)
  (h₁ : m + x + n ≤ y + n + m) :
  (m + x + n) * z + k ≤ z * (y + n + m) + k :=
by ac_mono* h₁.
```

By giving `ac_mono` the assumption `h₁`, we are asking `ac_refl` to
stop earlier than it would normally would.

### use
Similar to `existsi`. `use x` will instantiate the first term of an `∃` or `Σ` goal with `x`.
Unlike `existsi`, `x` is elaborated with respect to the expected type.
Equivalent to `refine ⟨x, _⟩`.

`use` will alternatively take a list of terms `[x0, ..., xn]`.

Examples:

```lean
example (α : Type) : ∃ S : set α, S = S :=
by use ∅

example : ∃ x : ℤ, x = x :=
by use 42

example : ∃ a b c : ℤ, a + b + c = 6 :=
by use [1, 2, 3]

example : ∃ p : ℤ × ℤ, p.1 = 1 :=
by use ⟨1, 42⟩
```

### clear_aux_decl

`clear_aux_decl` clears every `aux_decl` in the local context for the current goal.
This includes the induction hypothesis when using the equation compiler and
`_let_match` and `_fun_match`.

It is useful when using a tactic such as `finish`, `simp *` or `subst` that may use these
auxiliary declarations, and produce an error saying the recursion is not well founded.

```lean
example (n m : ℕ) (h₁ : n = m) (h₂ : ∃ a : ℕ, a = n ∧ a = m) : 2 * m = 2 * n :=
let ⟨a, ha⟩ := h₂ in
begin
  clear_aux_decl, -- subst will fail without this line
  subst h₁
end

example (x y : ℕ) (h₁ : ∃ n : ℕ, n * 1 = 2) (h₂ : 1 + 1 = 2 → x * 1 = y) : x = y :=
let ⟨n, hn⟩ := h₁ in
begin
  clear_aux_decl, -- finish produces an error without this line
  finish
end
```
### set

`set a := t with h` is a variant of `let a := t`. It adds the hypothesis `h : a = t` to the local context and replaces `t` with `a` everywhere it can.

`set a := t with ←h` will add `h : t = a` instead.

`set! a := t with h` does not do any replacing.

```lean
example (x : ℕ) (h : x = 3)  : x + x + x = 9 :=
begin
  set y := x with ←h_xy,
/-
x : ℕ,
y : ℕ := x,
h_xy : x = y,
h : y = 3
⊢ y + y + y = 9
-/
end
```

## omega

`omega` attempts to discharge goals in the quantifier-free fragment of linear integer and natural number arithmetic using the Omega test. In other words, the core procedure of `omega` works with goals of the form
```lean
∀ x₁, ... ∀ xₖ, P
```
where `x₁, ... xₖ` are integer (resp. natural number) variables, and `P` is a quantifier-free formula of linear integer (resp. natural number) arithmetic. For instance:
```lean
example : ∀ (x y : int), (x ≤ 5 ∧ y ≤ 3) → x + y ≤ 8 := by omega
```
By default, `omega` tries to guess the correct domain by looking at the goal and hypotheses, and then reverts all relevant hypotheses and variables (e.g., all variables of type `nat` and `Prop`s in linear natural number arithmetic, if the domain was determined to be `nat`) to universally close the goal before calling the main procedure. Therefore, `omega` will often work even if the goal is not in the above form:
```lean
example (x y : nat) (h : 2 * x + 1 = 2 * y) : false := by omega
```
But this behaviour is not always optimal, since it may revert irrelevant hypotheses or incorrectly guess the domain. Use `omega manual` to disable automatic reverts, and `omega int` or `omega nat` to specify the domain. 
```lean
example (x y z w : int) (h1 : 3 * y ≥ x) (h2 : z > 19 * w) : 3 * x ≤ 9 * y := 
by {revert h1 x y, omega manual}

example (i : int) (n : nat) (h1 : i = 0) (h2 : n < n) : false := by omega nat

example (n : nat) (h1 : n < 34) (i : int) (h2 : i * 9 = -72) : i = -8 := 
by {revert h2 i, omega manual int}
```
`omega` handles `nat` subtraction by repeatedly rewriting goals of the form `P[t-s]` into `P[x] ∧ (t = s + x ∨ (t ≤ s ∧ x = 0))`, where `x` is fresh. This means that each (distinct) occurrence of subtraction will cause the goal size to double during DNF transformation.

`omega` implements the real shadow step of the Omega test, but not the dark and gray shadows. Therefore, it should (in principle) succeed whenever the negation of the goal has no real solution, but it may fail if a real solution exists, even if there is no integer/natural number solution.
### push_neg

This tactic pushes negations inside expressions. For instance, given an assumption
```lean
h : ¬ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ → |f x - y₀| ≤ ε)
```
writing `push_neg at h` will turn `h` into
```lean
h : ∃ ε, ε > 0 ∧ ∀ δ, δ > 0 → (∃ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ ∧ ε < |f x - y₀|),
```
(the pretty printer does *not* use the abreviations `∀ δ > 0` and `∃ ε > 0` but this issue
has nothing to do with `push_neg`).
Note that names are conserved by this tactic, contrary to what would happen with `simp`
using the relevant lemmas. One can also use this tactic at the goal using `push_neg`,
at every assumption and the goal using `push_neg at *` or at selected assumptions and the goal
using say `push_neg at h h' ⊢` as usual.
